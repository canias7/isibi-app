/**
 * THE SQL MUTATION SPEC — the schema's guarantees, broken on purpose.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY. The JavaScript sweep runs the unit suite, which
 * cannot see a schema, so until now no database guarantee had been proved by
 * BREAKING the schema and watching a check go red. Sixty hand-written checks are
 * adversarial but they are not mechanical: nothing showed they would catch a
 * schema edited in a way nobody thought of. This closes that for the four
 * guarantees that matter most.
 *
 * FOCUSED, on the four claims the notes make loudest:
 *   tenant isolation · duplicate prevention · journal immutability ·
 *   whole-run deletion.
 *
 * Each mutant is a change that a careless edit could really make — a policy
 * loosened, a `unique` dropped, a raise turned into a return, a marker widened —
 * not a syntax error. A migration that will not apply proves nothing.
 *
 * NOT MUTATED, AND SAID OUT LOUD: `force row level security`. Removing it would
 * only be observable to a table OWNER who is not a superuser, and the harness's
 * owner IS one — superusers bypass row level security whatever FORCE says. So that
 * one line's effect is unverifiable here and a mutant of it would survive for a
 * reason that has nothing to do with the schema being right.
