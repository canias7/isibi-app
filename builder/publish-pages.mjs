// Deciding what actually gets published.
//
// This is the part of a build that spends money and chooses what a visitor ends
// up seeing: whether the caller can be billed at all, what the call actually
// cost, and whether to publish or fall back. It lived inside worker.js, which
// cannot be imported, so none of it was ever tested — and it is exactly where a
// silent bug is expensive rather than merely wrong.
//
// It used to decide one more thing — whether to pay for a repair pass, and
// whether that repair was an improvement worth keeping. That is gone; see the
// note at the call site for the measurement it went on.
//
// Everything it touches is injected, the way site-data.mjs takes its database
// functions, so the real decision logic can be driven against fakes with no
// model call, no container and no R2.

// input at the fresh rate, and the eval's, which priced cache reads and writes
// properly — so what a customer was billed and what we told ourselves a build
// cost were computed from different numbers.
//
// A cache read is a TENTH of fresh input and the cached prefix is 27,170 tokens,
// far the largest input component, so flattening the three kinds overcharged a
// warm build by ~9 credits — 35%. Measured: 35 charged against a true 26.
//
// It got worse the same day rather than being long-standing. `usedIn` used to be
// `input_tokens` alone, so cached tokens were not counted AT ALL (21 credits);
// counting them was right and pricing them at 10x was not, and the bill moved
// 21 -> 35 without anyone deciding it should.
