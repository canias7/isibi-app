// Deciding what actually gets published.
//
// This is the part of a build that spends money and chooses what a visitor ends
// up seeing: whether the caller can be billed at all, what the call actually
// cost, and whether to publish or fall back. It lived inside worker.js, which
// cannot be imported, so none of it was ever tested — and it is exactly where a
// silent bug is expensive rather than merely wrong.
//
// It used to decide one more thing — whether to pay for a repair pass, and
// whether that repair was an improvement worth keeping. That is gone; see the
// note at the call site for the measurement it went on.
//
// Everything it touches is injected, the way site-data.mjs takes its database
// functions, so the real decision logic can be driven against fakes with no
// model call, no container and no R2.

 * brief + schema → route files → compile → published dist.

 * Best-effort by design: it runs AFTER the database has been provisioned and the
 * schema applied, so a generator or compiler failure still leaves the caller a
 * working backend and a placeholder — a build that half-worked, not one that was
 * lost. The return says which landed, so a fallback is never mistaken for a site.
 *
 * ONE model call, always. `generate` is called exactly once and its cost is the
 * build's cost; there is no second attempt to sum or to choose between.
 *
 * deps:
 *   generate()      → { input, truncated?, usedIn, usedOut }   the model call
 *   compile(pages)  → { ok, files?, error?, stage? }           the build container
 *   publish(dist)   → void                                     write to storage
 *   readCredits()   → number
 *   useCredits(n)   → void
