// IS IT REACHABLE? — the check this repo keeps needing and keeps not having.
//
// The pattern, five times over: something is written, tested, on disk, and
// reachable by NOTHING. The 27 blocks, the 196 examples, the 1,140 charts, and
// eleven schema-engine features all shipped that way. Every one of them
// compiled, every unit test passed, and none of it could be used.
//
// site-theme.mjs and site-layouts.mjs were the sixth and seventh: both were
// imported only by their own tests when this file was written, so no generated
// site could carry a theme or a layout family. These assertions are the chain
// from a module on disk to a value in a built site, checked link by link,
// because every previous instance had four of five links working.
