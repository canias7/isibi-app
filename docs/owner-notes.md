# Owner Notes

Kept for the owner. Two purposes:
1. **How you like things done** — durable preferences, so a fresh session does not
   have to relearn them.
2. **What is open** — bugs, decisions waiting on you, and gaps worth knowing about.

**Read this at the start of every session.** Add a preference line whenever the
owner signals one; move an item out of Open the moment it is resolved.

## How you like things done

**Communication**
- **Plain English, not jargon.** Walk things layer by layer when touring the code.
- **Show UI changes as screenshots** — you review visually. Render it and send it.
- **Say plainly what is proven and what is not.** Every claim gets "proven live"
  or "NOT proven live". Corrections get written down, not quietly fixed.
- **One thing at a time.** You prefer reviewing and fixing bugs one by one over
  big batches.

**Changes**
- **Small and surgical** — do not restyle or refactor beyond what was asked.
- **"If we are not using it, I don't want it on the code."** Dead code goes.
- When you narrow a job mid-change, the scope is exactly what you named.
- **Desktop-first, no mobile** — *"I'm not preparing my app to be mobile friendly
  honestly."* Do not build or pitch mobile layout work unless you re-open it.
- Bulk or destructive operations **dry-run by default**.

**Money**
- **Never spend credits without asking.** Not on a test build, not on a retry.
- **Never auto-retry a failed build** — *"we should not spend your credits for
  you."* You can always ask again.
- Paid builds are **opt-in by a commit-message marker**, so no push can buy one
  by accident.
- **Documentation-only changes must not deploy** and must not buy a test build.
- **Do not raise the free-credit grant to paper over a shortfall** — *"Use my
  account, don't raise the credit thing."*
- Batch fixes into one live run. Six runs in a night drains the account faster
  than a day of real customers.
- Diagnose from the code before spending a run — *"you said to work it out
  first."*
- You delete leftover test sites yourself.

**How the model should be instructed**
- **"I just want the model to write its own css cmon, lets make it no name."**
  No menus, no enums, no named options where the model can author instead.
- **Delete worked examples; state only the purpose.** A worked example is the one
  thing a model reliably copies — two features shipped verbatim copies of ours.
- **"When in doubt, say less to the model."** Three drafts of the attachment note
  each got shorter and each got better.
- **"Don't invent something the customer hasn't asked for — invent something that
  is related to what the customer wants."** An invented detail stays inside the
  brief.
- **A cap the model is only told about is not a cap.** Enforce it in code.
- **An edit is measured against what was asked.** *"If the user wants one thing,
  you change one thing. If the user wants three, you change three… do not change
  something that the user hasn't told you to change."* And each change reaches
  only as far as the ask did — restyling one button is a rule for that button,
  not a new site-wide colour that happens to repaint it.
- **Editing the look is FREE CSS, not a theme picker.** *"Instead of it being a
  specific theme, it's free css — the model can edit anything on the page."*
  Nothing on the page is out of reach of a rule. The freedom and the ceiling are
  one instruction, never separated: anything may change, only what was asked
  does.
- **"They gotta be smart with the questions, not all the time."**
- **"I just want it treated normal, like an attachment — the user will say what he
  wants that for, it's part of the conversation."**

**Product direction**
- **"For edit it should be able to edit literally everything"** it can build — and
  **an edit changes exactly what was asked for and nothing else.** Absent means
  unchanged, never restated.
- **Cost follows the change, not the pipeline.** When asked whether two things
  should be one: do they differ in what somebody DECIDES, or only in how it is
  carried out? Only the first justifies two paths.
- **"The whole site can't not go live if one step breaks — if one step breaks it's
  gotta ship like that, however it is."**
- **"If I close the app the build is still running."**
- **Frontend first**: a first build designs and writes a site; the backend comes
  when editing or when an addon asks for it.
- **"It's gotta be more universal stuff"** — prefer a universal law over a one-off
  patch.
- **Everything is chatbox-driven.** Studio and the video editor were dropped:
  *"pure AI, drop it all."*
- **Rejected a picker** in favour of just attaching the file and saying what it
  is: *"Hey, this is my logo, put it there."*
- **Existing published sites are left alone** — never sweep-rebuild them. A
  rebuild costs credits and re-rolls the customer's page copy.
- **No arbitrary HTML in the head.** Every website builder offers "paste anything
  into your head" and every one of them is a way to get a site hacked.

**Zephyr — the media product (isibi.ai)**
- **Never name the provider to a user.** "fal" is an implementation detail; error
  bodies and UI copy say what went wrong, never who we bought it from.
- **The chatbox settings are authoritative** — *"the orchestrator has no power to
  change anything that's set on the chatbox."* A generation runs with exactly what
  the toggles show. The director's words never silently change a setting or a
  price. Sound was the one exception and was removed on all three layers.
- **"Make sure you show users the exact error."** The provider's own detail is
  quoted verbatim — *(exact error: "duration: must be one of 4s, 6s, 8s")* — not
  bucketed into a canned line. Quota and balance messages stay clean, because
  there is no useful upstream detail there.
- **A platform failure is never blamed on the user**, and a failed render always
  refunds.
- **Caps are not printed in the UI** — the app rejects loudly with the reason
  instead. A number in a tooltip goes stale; a refusal cannot.
- **Verify a model's limits against the provider's machine schema, never its docs
  page.** The docs have been wrong; the schema is what the API enforces.
- **Only chat-generated media belongs in the Gallery.**
- **Users think in verbs** — "Edit image", not "Image to image".
- **Grids scale by adding columns, never by growing cards.**
- **Skip the Media Agent** in click-throughs and sweeps unless it is the subject.

**Working discipline**
- **Work on the designated branch**, not main directly. `git push origin
  HEAD:<branch>` is the only form that cannot push the wrong commit, and `git log
  --oneline -1 origin/<branch>` is the only proof — the push output is not.
- **A green merge is not a green deploy.** Confirm the deploy run succeeded before
  testing anything live.
- **Never write GitHub's own skip-CI marker anywhere** — not in a commit message,
  not in a PR body, not while explaining it. It silently suppresses every
  workflow: main moves, nothing deploys, and there is no red run to notice. Done
  twice, both times inside prose about the rule itself. Say "the skip-CI marker".
- **Never commit while a mutation sweep is running** — an interrupted sweep leaves
  a live mutant in the tree.
- **Do NOT edit these notes with `perl -0pi` and a unicode `\x{…}` literal** — it
  re-encodes the file as latin1 and mojibakes every dash and emoji. Use the Edit
  tool for prose.
- **Render and look before shipping** — *"keep me updated with render stuff."*
  Several bugs were found only by opening a PNG, never by a passing test.
- **Do not change the highest-leverage prompt in the middle of a run you are
  trying to read.**

## Open — waiting on you

**0. The edit step is split, all 17 lanes act; ADDON is not, and DELETE is parked.**
Your drawing is saved at **`docs/architecture.md`** — the site at the centre, one
BUILD step making it, then EDIT / ADDON / DELETE acting on it and each publishing
back through the one spine. **EDIT is done** (2026-08-29): its own module, its own
tools, no `design_schema`, 4,012 chars of tool where it was 84,817, still 1
credit. **ADDON has the identical defect** — it still calls the build's designer
with the whole 84.8k tool to add one page — and is the obvious next one.
**DELETE is parked at your word** (*"we are gonna worry about delete later"*).

**All 17 lanes act**, your call (*"i need all the 17 lanes acting"*): 8 in the
edit path itself, 6 by dispatching to the layer that really does that work
(`images`→picture, `action`→nav, `backend`→rules, `shape`/`components`/`purpose`
→page), and **3 that are genuinely not built** and escalate under their own name.
Those three are real work, not wiring — say which you want:
- **`kind`** — shopfront ⇄ tool. A rebuild by definition; every planning answer
  follows from it.
- **`pages`** — three capabilities behind one field: add (addon), remove (`page`
  + `remove`), move (`renameRoute`). The router has to say WHICH before a lane
  can pick.
- **`slug`** — the site's address. Republish under a new name, redirect the old
  one, and keep every custom domain pointing at it.

**Every prompt in there is a placeholder**, marked as such, waiting on your
wording (*"i will tell you the prompt later"*). One `hint` and one `edit` string
per lane, all in one table.

**1. The model account is at 18 credits — under the price of one build.**
Five shipped features have never run on a real site and all five ride the same
build: the model-drawn favicon, the drawn wordmark, the composed share card, the
share-image picker, and the standard head tags. **One top-up proves all five at
once.** (Verified against the ledger 2026-08-28. Note the building account is
`aniascristian@gmail.com`, not the address these notes are addressed to.)

**2. Every scheduled job on the platform has never sent anything.**
26 jobs, all switched on, zero sends ever — verified live: 11 report "the site's
database is unreachable", 11 "this job is no longer part of the site", 4 have
never run. One wrong line repeated in three places passes the wrong kind of value
to the lookup. **Deliberately not fixed**: switching it on starts 26 real email
and SMS senders on real customers' sites. Ten-minute change when you say so.

**3. No card has ever been charged.** The payments path is built and tested and
has never seen a real Stripe key on a real site. Needs one test-mode key.

**4. Spam protection (Turnstile) has no live proof, and SMS cannot have a free
one** — SMS needs a real Twilio account and every message costs money.

**5. Two Neon projects are still billing for nothing.** `orange-frog-62041286`
and `soft-tree-10362597`, left behind by early smoke runs before the teardown
queue existed. Delete them next time you are in the Neon console. (Every project
since is cleaned up automatically — the queue fires on the row being deleted.)

**6. Kling and Gemini have no tier badges** — *"i will do kling and gemini
later."* The price tables are settled; the labels are yours to write.

**7. Leaked-password protection is still off in Supabase Auth.** One toggle: it
checks new passwords against HaveIBeenPwned. Verified still disabled 2026-08-28.

## Open — bugs and gaps

**Live bugs**

- **Fixed 2026-08-29 (the second half): the same refusal was in the shared
  publish step.** The first fix opened the two lanes and the change then hit the
  same wall one level down — the step every cheap edit publishes through asked
  for a database too. So *nothing* cheap worked on a site without one: not a
  wording fix, not a menu change, not a photo swap. **20 of your 47 sites** are
  in that state; the older ones (the-lido-cafe and its era) have databases and
  were fine, which is why this never showed up before. Now it asks whether the
  site *exists* rather than whether it has a database. Proven by driving the real
  route; not yet proven on a live site.
- **Fixed 2026-08-28: every colour change cost ~17 credits instead of under one.**
  The cheap CSS editor refused to run on any site without a database — and a new
  site doesn't get one unless it needs to store something, so this was most of
  your sites. The change got bumped up to the full page rewrite every time. The
  logo swap had the identical fault, and that rung is supposed to be free. Found
  by running a real edit on `shoeroom-1`: "make the footer black" worked, looked
  right, and quietly cost 17. Neither lane ever used the database it was asking
  for — the stylesheet and the logo live in file storage. *Fixed, with guards and
  a mutation sweep; not yet proven on a live site (needs credits).*

- **Fixed same day, never reached a site: the canonical was malformed on every
  page but the home page.** The head tags shipped 28 August glued the site's
  address (which ends in a slash) to the page's path (which starts with one), so
  `/menu` declared itself as `https://slug.gofarther.app//menu` in both its
  canonical and its share link. That is not a cosmetic slip — a browser reads
  `//menu` as a different *site*, so the tag would have pointed search engines
  away from the site entirely. Caught the same afternoon; the last site published
  was 11 hours before the bug existed, so no customer site ever carried it. Worth
  knowing because it says something about the tests rather than the code: both
  the unit guard and the container harness certified it, because the harness's
  fixture had typed the address by hand and got that one slash wrong. The fixture
  now comes from the real code instead.

- **`Tooltip` crashes any page that uses it.** The kit's `Tooltip` is a bare Radix
  root with no provider, nothing mounts one at the app root, and `tooltip` is in
  the list the generator is told it may use. It typechecks, bundles, publishes,
  and throws when a visitor loads the page. Two-line fix either way (self-provide,
  or mount one at the root) — flagged rather than chosen. *Verified still true
  2026-08-28.*
- **Fake controls on one-page sites.** On `northgroup-17` the stage filters, "New
  deal" and every deal row link to the band they already sit in — 15 of 24
  in-page links are dead by construction — while the builder's reply claims the
  filters work. The fix is a structural lint: a link whose target is its own
  ancestor is dead. Not built.
- **A brand-new site is unreachable for roughly its first minute** after publish.
  Warming it at the end of a build is an unmade decision.
- **A price change once failed with nothing applied**, on a table where a row
  could be removed and restored seconds later. Never diagnosed.

**Zephyr (isibi.ai)**

- **The landing filmstrip 404s on every view.** It draws cells from
  `/mkt/f1.jpg`…`f14.jpg` and none of those files exist — ~14 failed requests per
  landing view. Either drop real output in, or gate the strip until the files are
  there. *Verified still true 2026-08-28.*
- **The Media Agent's "Schedule post" tab is frontend only.** Composing queues to
  `localStorage`; nothing publishes, and the media is previewed locally rather
  than uploaded. The composer says "Preview · not published yet", so nobody is
  misled — the Composio wiring is the pending half.
- **Some fal price cards are unverified**: Seedance Fast/Mini and the reference
  cards, the Fast-reference-at-4K tier question, and the 0.6× video-reference
  billing basis. One live check each, whenever you next fund a sweep.
- **Dead CSS**, four blocks: the removed sidebar nav, the orchestrator upsell,
  the CRT knobs/HUD, and about half the old Morphic landing. 100% inert —
  cosmetic debt, and by your own rule it should go.
- **SSRF DNS-rebinding is deliberately not fixed**: the link-fetcher blocks
  internal addresses but never resolves DNS, so a public hostname pointing at a
  private IP is not caught. There is no clean Cloudflare Workers fix — no DNS
  resolution API — so this is a known accepted risk, not an oversight.

**Things the builder still cannot do**

- **Turn a constraint OFF** (uniqueness, no-overlap, one-per-customer, row caps)
  or change which columns one covers. There is not one `DROP INDEX` in the repo.
- **Rename a site's web address.** A customer whose site says "The Chair Room" at
  `sharp-fade-barbers.gofarther.app` is stuck with it; the only exit is
  delete-and-rebuild, which loses everything.
- **Add any third-party tag** — Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, a chat widget,
  Calendly. Structurally impossible under the published-site security policy.
- Drop a table, bulk-delete rows, use an external image URL, set a page to
  no-index, offer social sign-in to a site's own members, or set per-site rate
  limits.
- **Per-page share previews** are still site-level only.
- **Right-to-left has never been built live.** The machinery works and is proven
  in a browser; no designer has ever chosen it on a real build (four Arabic
  attempts, no site).

**Known-inert and worth a decision**

- **~17 schema features are parsed, stored and acted on by nothing** —
  `transitions`, `sla`, `roundRobin`, `assignBy`, `webhooks`, `geo`, `currency`,
  `formulas`, `searchWeights`, `jsonShapes`, `checks`, `computed`, `defaultSort`,
  `fieldRoles`, `teamRead`, `approval`, `sequence`. Nothing can declare them, so
  no site is broken — but by your own rule they should go.
- **There is no linter in the repo.** `no-undef` alone would catch the class of
  bug that has caused three separate total outages (a name used but never bound —
  it passes `node --check`, bundles, and throws at runtime).
- **The `access` field is marked required while the tool tells the model to leave
  it out** — a contradiction in the highest-leverage prompt.
- **The Data panel mislabels a table declared as a read/write pair** and offers an
  "email me on submissions" toggle on a table nobody can submit to. Harmless.
- **Three Cloud cards are still dead**: Edge functions, Emails, Files.
- **`claim_token` has no backfill** — bookings taken before a manage-page edit
  cannot be managed by the customer who made them.
- **97 kit components draw a supplied link as a plain anchor**, so on the
  `/s/<slug>/` mount they full-page-reload instead of routing. Not broken on the
  real `.gofarther.app` address.
- **The mobile menu**: a site's primary button sits outside the sheet, so it is
  unreachable while the menu is open, and the panel is two links in a tall wide
  box. True of every site we build — design decisions to make on purpose.
- **`build smoke` still has ~40 checks written for a build that has a database**,
  which a frontend-first build correctly does not have. It stops with one honest
  failure instead of pretending.

---

## What is live

**The builder.** A customer describes a business in chat and gets a published
site at `<slug>.gofarther.app`. One design call decides everything: what KIND of
thing it is (a shopfront or a working tool), the theme (from 500, shown a
100-name shortlist), a drawn favicon, the logo (the name in type or a drawn
wordmark), the page's shape from a 13-shape reference book, up to 15 components,
the photographs, and its own stylesheet. **One page, one job** — a band that is
really a second screen is left out rather than stacked below.

**Editing.** Cheapest rung that can express the change: words (free), rows and
list order, schema rules, the look, a photograph, the logo, the menu and footer,
one page's layout, and only then a full page rewrite. An edit changes what was
asked and nothing else — a tweak that moved the words is thrown away.

**Every site gets, free:** a share card composed at build time (the name and
description on the theme's own paper, 1200×630), a real tab icon, a home-screen
icon, the standard head tags every site on the web has, a sitemap, honest 404s,
redirects when a page is renamed, and an error panel that tells you when a
visitor's browser hit a problem.

**The owner's own controls** (Cloud): Files with the link-preview picker, Data,
Members, Domains, Secrets, Backups (nightly, kept 7), Version history with a real
restore, Security log, Errors, Analytics, and an on/off switch per scheduled job.

**Zephyr, the media side.** The chatbox at isibi.ai generates images, video and
voice through a curated lineup of models, metered in credits at 1 credit =
$0.008 of provider cost. An orchestrator writes the prompt from what you typed (and searches the web
when the request needs current facts), but it never touches a setting you chose.
Gallery, avatars and chats sync across devices; a universal memory learns your
taste from ordinary conversation and applies it to every generation, with no UI
of its own. The Media Agent reads Instagram and YouTube and auto-replies to
comments; DMs are blocked pending Meta's review.

**Payments and mail are bring-your-own.** You paste your own Stripe key and your
own mail key into a site's Secrets; we are never in the money flow and take no
cut. Our own sender is for signing in to Go Farther and nothing else.

**Analytics is collecting** and has been since 15 August: 451 page views in the
7 days to 28 August across ~25 sites. Cloudflare → Analytics → Web Analytics, or
the free `rum report` check.

---

## Parked — do not build until re-opened

- **The 8 home presets** (Blitz Motion and the rest) — *"forget about them for
  now."* Assets kept: Blitz Motion has an approved sample prompt and model pick.
- **The voice lane on the landing filmstrip** — built and removed twice. The
  second removal was a wrong-project merge, not a design rejection; the bigger
  300×118 version is the one you approved visually.
- **Luma Reframe** — offered, declined. Do not re-pitch.

---

## Names that must not be renamed

These are load-bearing strings, not branding. Renaming any of them breaks
something live: `isibi:meta`, `$isibi$`, `isibi-analytics-v1`, `isibi-<slug>`,
`isibi-app`, `isibi-sites`, `isibi-user-*`, `isibi.schema.json`.

Also: the **`react-day-picker` pin at `^9.14.0`** must stay. `calendar.tsx` needs
v9 and a v10 upgrade breaks it. Do not "clean it up".

---

## Security posture

Last full sweep 2026-07-20, zero findings, tested as real signed-in users:

- **Money** — a normal user cannot call the minting RPCs, cannot make
  `use_credits` add, and has no write grant on any money table. Minting is
  service-role only.
- **Row-level security** — user A reads zero rows of B's credits, purchases,
  plan, chats, memory, assets or usage.
- **SSRF** — every internal address blocked on the link-fetcher, including
  decimal, hex, octal and IPv4-mapped-IPv6 encodings and the cloud metadata
  address; non-HTTP schemes refused.
- **Storage** — the media bucket is path-scoped per user; uploading into someone
  else's folder is refused.
- **Stripe webhook** — unsigned and forged-signature events both rejected, no
  credits minted.
- **Generation** — unauthenticated is refused, and a model not on the allow-list
  is refused before any spend.

Since then: every declared database function is revoked from PUBLIC (Postgres
grants EXECUTE to everyone by default — that was a real hole, found by a test on
its first run), member sessions are cookies scoped to the site's own API path,
and a payable table gets no public insert grant at all, so a price can only ever
come from the site's own rows.

**Two standing advisor warnings that are NOT holes**, written down so nobody
re-investigates them: `queue_neon_teardown` is flagged as callable by a signed-out
visitor, and it returns `trigger` — Postgres refuses to run a trigger function
outside a trigger, so the call cannot succeed. And the tables flagged as "RLS on,
no policies" are that way **on purpose**: no policies means nobody but the service
key can read them, which is the whole point for the connection-string table.

**One accounting fact:** ✦300 was once added to the ledger by hand rather than
bought through Stripe (the minting function needs a secret that lives in GitHub
Actions). It has long since been spent; the balance today is 18.
