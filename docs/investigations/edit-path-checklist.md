# Remaining edit-path checklist

## The consolidated milestone (2026-09-25, late) — on the branch, not merged

The owner asked for one batch across six areas. Each item below is marked
**demonstrated**, **reproduced defect** (fixed on the branch), **unverified**
or **deferred**. Everything fixed is on `claude/help-needed-ehlwlj`, **not
merged or deployed**. Every model answer in the evidence is supplied, so the
tests prove what the route and the browser do with an answer, never that a real
model gives it.

### 1. Target selection

| Item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A quoted or unreadable page after "on" dropped out unread (`d6f5e55e`) | reproduced defect, fixed | Independent review: 188 focused tests, both CI checks green. |
| "Remove the ‘Chords’ section on the menu" removed it from `/` on a site with `/menu` | reproduced defect, fixed (`01222bab`) | The guard reads the site's own page names: each page's last address segment and every label its own menu links with. 13 cases, red 6 of 201 on the parent. Probes `page-names.json`: 18 killed, 2 controls. |
| An unknown or shared page name authorising another page | demonstrated | A name two pages share names neither; words that name no page on the site ("at the top") keep their meaning. |
| Quoted replacement text kept as data; collateral-removal controls | demonstrated | The existing `edit-page-keep` controls pass unchanged. |

### 2. Failure and billing paths

| Item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A routing answer that cannot be acted on dropped the message's words and files | reproduced defect, fixed (`9e70f093`) | `lost()` holds them on the site they came from. 9 cases red on the parent; the 33 stop cases in `site-route-failure` now assert the hold. |
| Unintended paid reconstruction from an edit or add-on escalation | demonstrated, no new defect | `EDIT_FAILURES` census, the add-on correction (`5cb8592`), and reply validation on both readers. **Deferred:** the add-on route's well-formed no-layer escalates still climb. |
| A stopped edit's unpublished design was shipped by the next edit | reproduced defect, fixed (`324bc47a`) | Cancel, correction still missing, no time left: the design is put back. 3 of 4 red on the parent. |
| The logo rung read bare strings, not the composer's `{name, data}` | reproduced defect, fixed (`51e39e3c`) | 4 of 5 red on the parent. |
| Refusal and partial wording: the routing charge, the charged refused step, "nothing was charged" | reproduced defect, fixed (`908c12ee`) | Server sentences say what happened; the browser states the edit's cost from the reply and the routing call's from the routing reply. A finished job's cost comes from its own row. A refused step's charge is on its entry and said beside the change that shipped. 8 of 15 red on the parent. Probes `edit-money.json`: 17 killed, 2 controls. |
| An unknown outcome sent the customer to the preview, which cannot show a data or rules change | reproduced defect, fixed (`a3efddef`) | It now says asking again could make the change twice. Red on the parent over four layers and three unknown shapes. |
| A change that went through before a failed publish was called untouched | reproduced defect, fixed (`90efa38d`) | A new address, a table rule and a saved row are named ("Part of it did go through, though: …"). 6 of 7 red on the parent, the control green on both. Probes `landed-changes.json`: 11 killed, 1 control. |

### 3. Database context on full rewrites

| Item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| An `incomplete` site's revise gave the writer the frontend rules | reproduced defect, fixed (`80ce60f4`) | The four-state reader resolves and proves the database read-only; the writer gets the database rules and the stored digest. |
| An unreachable database was treated as no database | reproduced defect, fixed (`80ce60f4`) | The revise stops, refunded, with `backend-unreadable`. |
| A `ready` site's revise digest lacked the site's functions | reproduced defect, fixed (`80ce60f4`) | Tables, functions and outside connections merge by name, the request's own entry winning. |
| Nothing repairs or provisions | demonstrated | Every query is a read; no reference write and no provisioning call, asserted. 5 cases, red 4 of 5 on the parent. |
| The new stop also fired on a first build, right after its database was made | reproduced defect, fixed (`8f66dfb9`) | Found while recording `80ce60f4`: a first build with a supplied schema, provisioned, catalog read refused, stopped with the revise's sentence. The stop is now for a revise alone; a first build builds on the schema it just applied, as before. 1 case, red on `80ce60f4`. Probes `revise-backend.json`: 9 killed, 1 control. |

### 4. Free coverage across the edit paths

All controlled, all with supplied answers. **No coverage test was added
without a concrete gap, and none was found.**

- **A second message after success, refusal and failure:** `edit-lock` (25
  two-message cases), `edit-result-display`, and the next-edit checks in
  `edit-failure-paths`.
- **Photographs:** preserved, restored and refused (`withheld`) on both
  writers, with authorised removal kept: `edit-page-photos`,
  `edit-page-protect`.
- **Deliberate component modification:** `edit-page-context` ("one changed
  component leaves the other exactly as it was", rendered with React) and the
  `edit-page-contract` route cases. Live: runs 21 and 24 changed
  `day-space-lookup`.
- **Picture, data and rules edits:** `edit-failure` (the data rung on an
  `incomplete` site, a component's photograph), `edit-rules-backend`,
  `edit-page-once` (the picture step), and the landed-change cases.
- **Partial success and queued completion:** `edit-failure` (mixed and
  all-refused), `edit-page-once` and `edit-failure-paths` (both money paths),
  `edit-reply-validation` and `edit-lock` (queued).

**Unverified live:** the full writer with the text guard and the judge; a
second message from the same browser; photographs; a live add-on; the picture,
data and rules rungs.

### 5. Deferred and known limits

- #418 (phone-width hydration) stays open.
- **Build path money wording.** "You weren't charged", `BUSY_BUILD_MSG`,
  `GATED_BUILD_MSG`, `STALE_BUILD_MSG`, the build timeout and `NO_CONTAINER_MSG`
  do not mention the routing charge. "Your database is live" is also said on a
  site that has none.
- **Add-on money wording.** The add-on reader states no routing charge, and
  `lostPhotosMsg` still says "nothing was charged".
- **Two money policies.** The synchronous path keeps a failed publish's
  collections, while the job path refunds them. A job also refunds a rename,
  row or rule that landed before its publish failed. Both are now reported
  from the ledger.
- **Text-guard grammar limits.** A site page name used as an ordinary word after
  on/in/from reads as that page and fails closed. Trailing commentary voids a
  clause.
- **Untested edges.** The correction-write belt (`eConfigWritten`) has no case,
  and the verify catch's restore is read in code but not driven.
- **A new cost.** A `ready` site whose tables cannot be recovered now has its
  revise refused, where before it was revised with the partial spec.
- Drafts last for the session only. The needs-review enqueue sentence is never
  shown.
- Real-model compliance is unproven throughout.

### 6. Live acceptance — Test 3, prepared and not dispatched

Run 32 stays closed.

- **Request:** "Remove the ‘The first eight chords’ section from the home
  page." — 63 characters, sha256 `48bdbf475e1718e6…`.
- **Site:** fretwork-1, live at `01790360265159-n7mtnq` (read 23:44Z).
- **Needs:** this branch merged and deployed (the page-name resolution, the
  canary's after-read wait), and the image re-predicted over the real merge. At
  `8f66dfb9` it is `c3cc126e45e93815`, 187 inputs (main: `a51d8b32e5869576`).
- **Re-checked against the current guard** (supplied answers, fretwork-1's
  stored `n7mtnq` home page): the correct removal passes, with or without the
  now-unused import and chord data; losing the guitar paragraph too refuses;
  the same removal judged as `/prices` refuses.
- **Expected:** `index.tsx` loses the chords block. The `ChordDiagram` import
  and the `CHORDS` data serve only that block, so either may go too; that is
  inspected and noted, not failed. Every other block and the rest of the code
  above the render stay byte-identical. `prices.tsx`, `gear.tsx` and
  the three component files stay byte-identical. The judge is called (the
  `chord-diagram` use goes) and publishes on the quote. The comparison is
  VERIFIED at the job's own version.
- **Cost:** about 17–25 credits (estimate, not a cap). Balance 91 at run 32's
  end.
- **Limits:** one sentence on one site. The writer's prompt is not captured. A
  text-guard refusal names no text. A publish is checked against the stored
  bodies and the live page, never taken as proof of preservation.

### Required CI

- **Unit:** run 36202704161 on `8f66dfb9` reads `7927 / 7923 / 0 / 4`, and all
  57 new or renamed test names pass by name. Locally the suite reads
  `7927 / 7925 / 0 / 2`, and the 25 test files the milestone touched read
  995 / 995.
- **Site build:** runs 36200973701 (`90efa38d`), 36201665364 (`80ce60f4`) and
  36202704088 (`8f66dfb9`). Each has all twelve counts green (TAP 397,
  site-build 382, and the rest as recorded) and only the two known
  annotations.

### Stopping point

The milestone stops here, pending the owner's review, merge and deploy. After
that come the free canary press, then Test 3 on approval. Nothing further is
started.

## Status after run 32 (2026-09-25)

*Superseded by the milestone section above. Its "still open" items for the
billing sentences, the charged refused step, the full revise on `incomplete`
sites, dropped attachments and the "Check the preview" wording are now fixed on
the branch.*

**Closed since this record was written.** Each of these is merged, deployed and
live:
- queued refusal redraw escape;
- preview invalidation after a synchronous scheduling exception;
- the queued one-hop marker (all three by the edit-path milestone, deploy
  2158);
- literal-text loss on the full page writer, for parsed literal JSX prose and
  its request grammar (deploy 2158);
- the credit-refusal wording that states the edit charge and the routing charge
  apart (deploy 2159, runtime-confirmed by run 32's preflight).

**Shown live.** Run 32 (canary 36172189711): one real-model edit through the
quick writer. The edit moved a section on fretwork-1 and kept the surrounding
source byte for byte. Routing, the queue, the publish, billing (route 2 + edit 8
against a single reserve) and the reply are all confirmed. A real Chromium,
rendering TLS-verified live bytes, confirmed the order, the 3D guitar and the
availability box against the real `bookings_on_day` (1 → "5 places left.",
0 → "Six places left.").

**Still not shown live.**
- The full page writer on this deployment, with the text guard and the judge
  in `keepCheck`.
- A second message from the same browser.
- Photographs.
- A live add-on, and the picture, data and rules rungs.

**Still open.**
- #418 (phone-width hydration).
- The text guard's scope limits. The two ordinary page-qualified phrasings it
  refused with a correct answer are fixed on the branch (`ce913d06` + `8c0d67a1`), not
  merged. So is the bypass where a quoted or unreadable page after "on" dropped
  out unread (`d6f5e55e`). See [text preservation](edit-text-preservation.md).
- Next-task 4's other billing sentences and the charged refused step.
- The full revise on `incomplete` sites.
- Attachments dropped by an unusable routing answer.
- The add-on route's no-layer climbs.
- The "Check the preview" wording on an unknown outcome.

**Harness.** The canary's early after-read is fixed on
`claude/help-needed-ehlwlj` (`72885ca9`, not merged).

**Next.** Test 3 is revised and not dispatched: "Remove the ‘The first eight
chords’ section from the home page.", after `ce913d06` + `8c0d67a1` + `d6f5e55e` are merged and deployed,
about 17–25 credits. A publish is read against the actual stored output and the
live page; a refusal is read by its reason, which for the text guard does not
say which text.

---

Historical closure record. The subsequent owner-authorized [full edit-path
review](edit-path-milestone.md) records the queued marker, refusal-display and
preview-ordering corrections on the review branch. Closed deployments below
remain closed; they were not rechecked.

Scope: current product at `5cb8592`, the recorded reviews and canary 28. This is
not a new lane audit. Escalation correction and deployment verification are
closed; no further deployment checks, retries or paid runs are requested.

## Demonstrated behavior (with the evidence boundary)

| Behavior | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Correct Worker/container identity, async and runner flags | Live non-spending canary 36096052737, 2026-09-25 04:50:36 UTC: `5cb8592661ff`, `b83b0611aeecce8f`, both flags true. Balance 3. |
| Empty edit queues and reaches its stored terminal refusal; forged replay and unknown-job poll are rejected | Same live canary. This did not call a model or demonstrate a content edit. |
| Failed/unreadable add-on state and unusable answers stop; verified absence alone permits reconstruction; photo handoff and successful additions remain | Actual Worker responses through direct and queued browser handlers with stubbed providers: `test/addon-failure.test.mjs`, `test/addon-route.test.mjs`. Independent review and required CI green. |
| Untrusted edit/add-on replies cannot authorize success or another operation | `readRouteReply`, `readEditReply`, `readAddonReply`; controlled reply tests in `test/edit-reply-validation.test.mjs`, `test/addon-failure.test.mjs`. |
| Ask lock survives handoffs, releases once, blocks duplicate presses; old completions do not unlock newer requests | `siteEdit`, `editAsk`, `editAskDone`; `test/edit-lock.test.mjs`. Previously corrected, not reopened. |
| Edit-side result-display failure preserves known success and permits a next message | `applyEditResult`; `test/edit-result-display.test.mjs`, including credit-scheduling and redraw fault injection. Previously corrected, not reopened. |
| Served browser code matches reviewed code | Recorded byte comparison of live `chat.js`. Draft isolation, routing and preservation behavior also have controlled tests; those tests do not prove every real model response. |

## Implemented, but not established by this live verification

- A nonempty model-backed edit/addition through the real browser, queue, model,
  compiler, publish and result-display chain on this deployment.
- Its exact requested change, preservation of unrelated content/behavior,
  visible preview, truthful partial-result wording and per-operation billing.
- Live reconstruction and photo handoff with real providers. Controlled tests
  cover their decisions; the empty-edit canary does not exercise them.

These are missing observations, **not product defects**. Do not repeat completed
deployment checks or spend credits merely to relabel the same evidence.

## Known remaining defects and limits

| Item | Current-code evidence and precise scope |
| --- | --- |
| Add-on known-success fallback redraw — CLOSED, deployed at a5741864 | The owner independently reproduced an escaped queued display error; publication and request cleanup succeeded. The fallback now uses the existing edit-side guarded finish. Focused regressions cover direct/queued double failures, the subsequent message and a newer request started during redraw. Ordinary success-redraw controls remain. |
| Queued refusal redraw can escape | `watchEditJob` invokes the outcome reader from its async step; refusal branches call `finish` without containing a redraw exception. Recorded impact: the sentence remains and the request frees, but a rejection can escape. No new live incident is claimed. |
| Preview invalidation can be skipped after a synchronous scheduling exception | `applyEditResult` and `applyAddonResult` call `scheduleCreditRefresh()` before incrementing `previewV`. The injected synchronous throw is recorded. **Do not describe this as every failed balance request:** the actual scheduler defers `fetchCredits` in a timer, so an ordinary later network failure does not establish this sequence. |
| Queued handoff loses the one-hop marker | `watchEditJob` supplies `handedOff:false` to its reader, whereas `escalatedEdit` uses that flag for the hop limit. Latent guard gap: the recorded current data→text and picture→page destinations do not hop again. Not evidence of a current live loop. |

Drafts surviving site switches but not browser reload are an intentional
in-memory limit (`siteDraft`, `sitesSave`), not a newly found defect. The silent
duplicate latch is likewise a deliberate secondary guard, not a stranded-request
regression. Translation and model-written replies remain parked.

## Fallback-display correction closed

The owner independently reproduced the queued add-on double display failure.
The regression also failed before the patch with “the redraw failed” escaping.
The existing edit-side guard now contains that fallback redraw exception.

All 179 focused tests pass in edit-result-display, edit-lock and addon-failure:
one truthful success, no rewrite or extra handoff, busy/lock released, subsequent
message completes, and an older completion leaves a newer request alone.
The harness reads normalize CRLF so these controls also run on Windows.

This is an escaped display error, not a failed publication or stranded request.
Independent review accepted the patch and all 179 focused tests. Required unit
CI [36098613431](https://github.com/canias7/isibi-app/actions/runs/36098613431)
passed (7,710 passed, zero failures). Site-build was not required for these paths.

Merged by fast-forward from unchanged main at 41abeaa5 to a5741864.
[Deployment 2157](https://github.com/canias7/isibi-app/actions/runs/36099179983)
succeeded on 2026-09-25 at 05:35:53 UTC, deploying reviewed commit
`a57418643340b67f9d51210c903dbe18e1e532f3`. The deployment log reports the
existing SiteBuildContainer image reused; this is deployment-log evidence, not
a new runtime container observation. No container check or canary was run.

At 05:36:30 UTC, both https://gofarther.dev/chat.js and its cache-busted URL
returned HTTP 200 and were byte-identical to the reviewed git blob: 781,511 bytes,
SHA-256 `d873ddb00e7375f7b9ace05ad92954eb4947f8d98802ff45b5bbff14e34a2c36`.
This verifies the served correction. No paid run. Other checklist items remain
separate and unchanged; no next sweep or additional correction is started.
