# Remaining edit-path checklist

## The consolidated milestone (2026-09-25, late) — merged and deployed at `7384ddba` (2026-09-26)

The owner asked for one batch across six areas. Each item below is marked
**demonstrated**, **reproduced defect** (now fixed), **unverified** or
**deferred**. The batch was reviewed at `4f6ab55c` and merged and deployed with
the rollback round at `7384ddba` (deploy 2160). Every model answer in the
evidence is supplied, so the tests prove what the route and the browser do with
an answer, never that a real model gives it.

### 1. Target selection

| Item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A quoted or unreadable page after "on" dropped out unread (`d6f5e55e`) | reproduced defect, fixed | Independent review: 188 focused tests, both CI checks green. |
| "Remove the ‘Chords’ section on the menu" removed it from `/` on a site with `/menu` | reproduced defect, fixed (`01222bab`) | The guard reads the site's own page names: each page's last address segment and every label its own menu links with. 13 cases, red 6 of 201 on the parent. Probes `page-names.json`: 18 killed, 2 controls. |
| An unknown or shared page name authorising another page | demonstrated | A name two pages share names neither; words that name no page on the site ("at the top") keep their meaning. |
| Quoted replacement text kept as data; collateral-removal controls | demonstrated | The existing `edit-page-keep` controls pass unchanged. |

### 2. Failure and billing paths

| Item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A routing answer that cannot be acted on dropped the message's words and files | reproduced defect, fixed (`9e70f093`) | `lost()` holds them on the site they came from. 9 cases red on the parent; the 33 stop cases in `site-route-failure` now assert the hold. |
| Unintended paid reconstruction from an edit or add-on escalation | demonstrated, no new defect | `EDIT_FAILURES` census, the add-on correction (`5cb8592`), and reply validation on both readers. Ordinary add-on failures stop with a sentence; the add-on route asks for a rebuild only when saved state is verified missing (the conditions are listed below this table). |
| A stopped edit's unpublished design was shipped by the next edit | reproduced defect, fixed (`324bc47a`) | Cancel, correction still missing, no time left: the design is put back. 3 of 4 red on the parent. |
| The logo rung read bare strings, not the composer's `{name, data}` | reproduced defect, fixed (`51e39e3c`) | 4 of 5 red on the parent. |
| Refusal and partial wording: the routing charge, the charged refused step, "nothing was charged" | reproduced defect, fixed (`908c12ee`) | Server sentences say what happened; the browser states the edit's cost from the reply and the routing call's from the routing reply. A finished job's cost comes from its own row. A refused step's charge is on its entry and said beside the change that shipped. 8 of 15 red on the parent. Probes `edit-money.json`: 17 killed, 2 controls. |
| An unknown outcome sent the customer to the preview, which cannot show a data or rules change | reproduced defect, fixed (`a3efddef`) | It now says asking again could make the change twice. Red on the parent over four layers and three unknown shapes. |
| A change that went through before a failed publish was called untouched | reproduced defect, fixed (`90efa38d`) | A new address, a table rule and a saved row are named ("Part of it did go through, though: …"). 6 of 7 red on the parent, the control green on both. Probes `landed-changes.json`: 11 killed, 1 control. |

**When the add-on route may ask for a rebuild.** A no-layer escalate from the
add-on route is the only add-on answer the browser turns into the full
rewrite, and the route produces one in exactly one place: the
`reconstruct: true` call in `worker.js` (`addonFailure` ignores the flag for
every reason but `no-source` and `no-meta`). It is reached only when every one
of these holds, in this order; each earlier failure stops with its own
sentence instead:

1. The message is not empty, and the picked model's key is configured.
2. The editable-state check passes and the page read succeeds
   (`loadSiteSourceForEdit` with `checked: true`). A failed read or a failed
   recovery stops (`editable-state`, `no-source`).
3. The database state is readable (`siteBackendDetail` is not `unreadable`).
4. The strict config read succeeds and, when the site has a database, the
   schema read succeeds (`specForAddon`). The spec must be well formed: a
   `tables` list, each with a name and a columns list. Otherwise it stops
   (`no-meta`).
5. It is not a stylesheet with no saved look. That is existing design, and it
   stops (`no-look`).
6. The saved state is positively missing: the page list read back empty
   (`no-source`), or no saved look and no stylesheet (`no-meta`).
7. The build configuration is present: the site database, the service key and
   the model key. Otherwise it stops (`unconfigured`).
8. The remaining component files read back under a strict read. Otherwise it
   stops (`no-meta`).

Only then does it answer `{ok: false, escalate: true, reason}` with no layer.
The browser climbs on that shape alone (`readAddonReply`'s `climb`); a
malformed escalate stops. The one other hop is a photograph asked for alone,
which goes sideways to the picture layer as a single edit, not a rebuild.

### 3. Database context on full rewrites

| Item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| An `incomplete` site's revise gave the writer the frontend rules | reproduced defect, fixed (`80ce60f4`) | The four-state reader resolves and proves the database read-only; the writer gets the database rules and the stored digest. |
| An unreachable database was treated as no database | reproduced defect, fixed (`80ce60f4`) | The revise stops, refunded, with `backend-unreadable`. |
| A `ready` site's revise digest lacked the site's functions | reproduced defect, fixed (`80ce60f4`) | Tables, functions and outside connections merge by name, the request's own entry winning. |
| Nothing repairs or provisions | demonstrated | Every query is a read; no reference write and no provisioning call, asserted. 5 cases, red 4 of 5 on the parent. |
| The new stop also fired on a first build, right after its database was made | reproduced defect, fixed (`8f66dfb9`) | Found while recording `80ce60f4`: a first build with a supplied schema, provisioned, catalog read refused, stopped with the revise's sentence. The stop is now for a revise alone; a first build builds on the schema it just applied, as before. 1 case, red on `80ce60f4`. Probes `revise-backend.json`: 9 killed, 1 control. |

### 4. Free coverage across the edit paths

All controlled, all with supplied answers. **No coverage test was added
without a concrete gap, and none was found.**

- **A second message after success, refusal and failure:** `edit-lock` (25
  two-message cases), `edit-result-display`, and the next-edit checks in
  `edit-failure-paths`.
- **Photographs:** preserved, restored and refused (`withheld`) on both
  writers, with authorised removal kept: `edit-page-photos`,
  `edit-page-protect`.
- **Deliberate component modification:** `edit-page-context` ("one changed
  component leaves the other exactly as it was", rendered with React) and the
  `edit-page-contract` route cases. Live: runs 21 and 24 changed
  `day-space-lookup`.
- **Picture, data and rules edits:** `edit-failure` (the data rung on an
  `incomplete` site, a component's photograph), `edit-rules-backend`,
  `edit-page-once` (the picture step), and the landed-change cases.
- **Partial success and queued completion:** `edit-failure` (mixed and
  all-refused), `edit-page-once` and `edit-failure-paths` (both money paths),
  `edit-reply-validation` and `edit-lock` (queued).

**Unverified live:** the full writer with the text guard and the judge; a
second message from the same browser; photographs; a live add-on; the picture,
data and rules rungs.

### 5. Deferred and known limits

- #418 (phone-width hydration) stays open.
- **Build path money wording.** "You weren't charged", `BUSY_BUILD_MSG`,
  `GATED_BUILD_MSG`, `STALE_BUILD_MSG`, the build timeout and `NO_CONTAINER_MSG`
  do not mention the routing charge. "Your database is live" is also said on a
  site that has none.
- **Add-on money wording.** The add-on reader states no routing charge, and
  `lostPhotosMsg` still says "nothing was charged".
- **Two money policies.** The synchronous path keeps a failed publish's
  collections, while the job path refunds them. A job also refunds a rename,
  row or rule that landed before its publish failed. Both are now reported
  from the ledger.
- **Text-guard grammar limits.** A site page name used as an ordinary word after
  on/in/from reads as that page and fails closed. Trailing commentary voids a
  clause.
- **The two rollback edges: closed** (the next round, `edit-failure-paths`).
  - *The correction's write flag* is redundant when the look step has already
    written, and it is the only record of a write when the css lane answered
    the stylesheet unchanged beside a step that publishes. The render check
    then still reads every rule in the stored sheet (below), so a stale rule
    starts the correction round, and the round's write is the message's only
    config write. Now driven through the route in that shape: a job whose
    correction still misses, and a synchronous edit whose corrected build the
    store refuses. Each checks the stored sheet put back, the reply, the
    ledger, and a next edit that does not ship the correction. A control in
    the same shape on both paths keeps a correction that lands. With the flag
    removed, both stop cases fail and both controls pass.
  - *The verify catch* cannot be reached by any failure the round can meet,
    because every operation inside it handles its own. Driven at each
    boundary: the correction's model call failing, its write refused, and the
    corrected build refused by the store and by the publish gate. Each lands
    on its own named outcome and puts the design back. With a marker in the
    catch, the whole suite (7,934 tests) reached it zero times. The catch
    stays as the defence against a defect in our own code.
- **Reproduced, not fixed: a failed restore after a publish failure of ours
  is not said.** `compileMsg` answers a failure of ours (and a refused
  reservation) with its own sentence. That sentence replaces the one that
  carries "the change is saved". So when the restore write fails too, the
  screen says only "our build service was restarting", while the change stays
  saved and the next edit ships it. Scratch reproduction on both paths, with
  supplied answers. It is narrow: the publish must fail on our side and the
  restore write must fail as well.
- **Found, not fixed: the stylesheet check reads the whole stored sheet, not
  this message's rules.** The code's comment says it verifies "the selectors
  this message introduced". The build service judges every rule in the stored
  sheet (`plainSelectors(readCss(payload.css).css)`). So a rule left dead by an
  earlier change starts the correction round on any later message that picks
  the css lane, even one whose css answer changed nothing. The correction then
  rewrites a rule the customer never mentioned; the new control case publishes
  exactly that, with supplied answers. On a job, a correction that still
  misses refuses and refunds the whole message, other steps included.
- **A new cost.** A `ready` site whose tables cannot be recovered now has its
  revise refused, where before it was revised with the partial spec.
- Drafts last for the session only. The needs-review enqueue sentence is never
  shown.
- Real-model compliance is unproven throughout.

### 6. Live acceptance — Test 3, prepared and not dispatched (waiting for spending approval)

Run 32 stays closed. **The prerequisite is met**: this batch is merged and
deployed (see the deploy entry), so a dispatch from `main` carries the page-name
resolution, the quoted-page reader and the canary's after-read wait.

- **The request, pasted verbatim into the "What to change" box:**
  "Remove the ‘The first eight chords’ section from the home page." — 63
  characters, 67 bytes (curly quotes U+2018 and U+2019), sha256
  `48bdbf475e1718e6ceaab4fee3a9941d13477f719616d262216a87dcbf2be823`.
- **The press:** `edit-canary.yml`, run from `main`. The form shows each
  box's description rather than its name:
  - "Run the ONE paid edit as well": `yes`.
  - "What to change": the sentence above.
  - "The site to edit": `fretwork-1`. "A second site…": `washhouse-3`.
  - "READ ONE EXISTING JOB AND STOP" and "PUT ONE SAVED VERSION BACK": blank.
  - "Refuse to spend unless the Worker reports this deploy sha": `7384ddbac4ba05b7251c52aa53d6fc9e018a9699`.
  - "Refuse to spend unless a cold container reports this image id": `c3cc126e45e93815`.
- **The starting state:** live `01790360265159-n7mtnq`, read again at
  01:01:55Z on 2026-09-26, with the headings in run 32's order. The press's own
  before-read must equal these six stored bodies:
  - `index.tsx` `6bb1fb500f7df623`;
  - `prices.tsx` `0d2d72dee56a2a71`;
  - `gear.tsx` `d580389f971cdd31`;
  - `chord-diagram` `d0c20d52f91d69d2`;
  - `trial-booking-form` `4b66386c0ad46092`;
  - `day-space-lookup` `4b162037f67df545`.
- **What records which writer ran.** `routing.json` holds the router's intent,
  layer and page, and the page list it was given. `terminal.json` holds the
  stored reply whole, which tells the writers apart:
  - `tweak: true` means the quick writer published and the full writer did not
    run. The quick writer cannot drop words, so on this sentence that outcome
    would itself be a finding.
  - `tweak` absent with `usage` present on a published page edit means the
    full writer published; `usage` carries its model and tokens.
  - `tweakUsage` means a quick attempt was made first.
  - `keepUsage` means the preservation judge ran.
  - A refusal names its reason. `prose-preservation` (with `proseBlocked`) is
    the text guard, which is asked only of the full writer's answer.
    `withheld` (with `contentBlocked`) is the judge refusing item by item.
    `contentUnchecked` means the judge failed.

  Full-writer coverage is claimed only when `tweak` is absent and the full
  writer's `usage` is on the reply.
- **Acceptance.** Each item is read from the evidence bundle and a real browser:
  1. **It counts as the test** only if the request sha matches, the press's
     own before-read equals the six bodies, the preflight passes with both
     expectations, and a stored terminal reply arrived.
  2. **Published at the job's own version.** The stored 200 arrives under
     `x-gf-edit: final`, and `x-site-version` moves to a version minted inside
     the run's window. `compare.json` says VERIFIED, with every after-page read
     at that version.
  3. **The requested removal, in the stored source.** `index.tsx` loses the
     section headed "The first eight chords", with its `ChordDiagram` grid. The
     `ChordDiagram` import and the `CHORDS` data serve only that block, so
     either may go too; that is noted, not failed. Every other top-level render
     block and the code above the render stay byte-identical.
  4. **Other pages and component bodies:** the other five files stay
     byte-identical. The `chord-diagram` file stays stored even though no page
     renders it: nothing deletes a component file.
  5. **The live page at that version.** The headings read, in order: Book a
     guitar lesson · A guitar you can turn · September 2026 · Space on a
     preferred day · Book a trial lesson · Book a trial lesson. There are no
     chord diagrams, the guitar canvas draws, and the day box answers the real
     `bookings_on_day`. `/prices` and `/gear` keep their headings and word
     lists. Console errors and failed requests are counted.
  6. **Money.** The balance moves by exactly the routing charge plus the edit's
     cost, and the edit's cost matches the ledger rows for its job.
  7. **The reply the customer sees** (`customer-reply.txt`) is checked against
     the bundle. The render check's #418 finding is passed on, not verified.
- **Cost:** about 18–27 credits, an estimate and not a cap. That is the
  routing charge (2), the full writer (~12–15, as in runs 21, 24 and 26), a
  quick attempt (from under 1 when it declines at once up to ~6 when it
  rewrites the page first, as in run 24), and the judge (~1). The balance was
  91 at run 32's end; the free press prints the current figure.
- **Reversible for free** with the restore mode (`01790360265159-n7mtnq`).
- **Limits:** one sentence on one site, and the writer's prompt is not
  captured. A text-guard refusal names no text and the refused answer is not
  stored, so a refusal cannot be blamed on the model. A publish is checked
  against the stored bodies and the live page, never taken as proof of
  preservation.

### Required CI

- **Unit:** run 36206886612 on `7384ddba` reads `7934 / 7930 / 0 / 4`. The
  seven new rollback cases and the kept control pass by name, with 7,934
  distinct result numbers and no `not ok`. Locally the suite reads
  `7934 / 7932 / 0 / 2`, and the 25 test files the milestone touched read
  1,002 / 1,002. The reviewed product tip `8f66dfb9` read `7927 / 7923 / 0 / 4`
  (run 36202704161).
- **Site build:** runs 36200973701 (`90efa38d`), 36201665364 (`80ce60f4`) and
  36202704088 (`8f66dfb9`). Each has all twelve counts green (TAP 397,
  site-build 382, and the rest as recorded) and only the two known
  annotations. The rollback round changed no file on the site build's paths,
  so the product tree it merged is `8f66dfb9`'s.

### Merged and deployed (2026-09-26)

Main was fast-forwarded `c2fa000c` → `7384ddba` (21 commits), which deployed as
deploy 2160 (run 36207057160, success, 01:02:52 → 01:05:53Z):
- The Worker reports `DEPLOY_ID` `7384ddba…`.
- The image was built as predicted, `c3cc126e45e93815` (187 inputs), and
  rolled over from `a51d8b32e5869576`.
- The served `chat.js` (786,047 bytes) and `edit-poll.js` (29,659 bytes) are
  byte-identical to the merged files.
- The rollback was verified before the push: it restores main's own tree.

A green deploy is Wrangler reporting on itself. **The runtime confirmation is
the free canary press** with both expectations set. The session's own dispatch
was re-tested at 01:22Z, once the image rollout had settled, and answered 403
again, so the press is yours:
- `edit-canary.yml`, run from `main`.
- "Run the ONE paid edit as well": `no`.
- "Refuse to spend unless the Worker reports this deploy sha":
  `7384ddbac4ba05b7251c52aa53d6fc9e018a9699`.
- "Refuse to spend unless a cold container reports this image id":
  `c3cc126e45e93815`.
- Every other box at its default.

The same press takes the before-read Test 3 starts from.

### Stopping point

The batch is merged and deployed, and the free press confirms it at runtime.
Test 3 is prepared above and waits for your spending approval. Nothing is
dispatched that spends.

## Status after run 32 (2026-09-25)

*Superseded by the milestone section above. Its "still open" items for the
billing sentences, the charged refused step, the full revise on `incomplete`
sites, dropped attachments and the "Check the preview" wording are now fixed on
the branch.*

**Closed since this record was written.** Each of these is merged, deployed and
live:
- queued refusal redraw escape;
- preview invalidation after a synchronous scheduling exception;
- the queued one-hop marker (all three by the edit-path milestone, deploy
  2158);
- literal-text loss on the full page writer, for parsed literal JSX prose and
  its request grammar (deploy 2158);
- the credit-refusal wording that states the edit charge and the routing charge
  apart (deploy 2159, runtime-confirmed by run 32's preflight).

**Shown live.** Run 32 (canary 36172189711): one real-model edit through the
quick writer. The edit moved a section on fretwork-1 and kept the surrounding
source byte for byte. Routing, the queue, the publish, billing (route 2 + edit 8
against a single reserve) and the reply are all confirmed. A real Chromium,
rendering TLS-verified live bytes, confirmed the order, the 3D guitar and the
availability box against the real `bookings_on_day` (1 → "5 places left.",
0 → "Six places left.").

**Still not shown live.**
- The full page writer on this deployment, with the text guard and the judge
  in `keepCheck`.
- A second message from the same browser.
- Photographs.
- A live add-on, and the picture, data and rules rungs.

**Still open.**
- #418 (phone-width hydration).
- The text guard's scope limits. The two ordinary page-qualified phrasings it
  refused with a correct answer are fixed on the branch (`ce913d06` + `8c0d67a1`), not
  merged. So is the bypass where a quoted or unreadable page after "on" dropped
  out unread (`d6f5e55e`). See [text preservation](edit-text-preservation.md).
- Next-task 4's other billing sentences and the charged refused step.
- The full revise on `incomplete` sites.
- Attachments dropped by an unusable routing answer.
- The add-on route's no-layer climbs.
- The "Check the preview" wording on an unknown outcome.

**Harness.** The canary's early after-read is fixed on
`claude/help-needed-ehlwlj` (`72885ca9`, not merged).

**Next.** Test 3 is revised and not dispatched: "Remove the ‘The first eight
chords’ section from the home page.", after `ce913d06` + `8c0d67a1` + `d6f5e55e` are merged and deployed,
about 17–25 credits. A publish is read against the actual stored output and the
live page; a refusal is read by its reason, which for the text guard does not
say which text.

---

Historical closure record. The subsequent owner-authorized [full edit-path
review](edit-path-milestone.md) records the queued marker, refusal-display and
preview-ordering corrections on the review branch. Closed deployments below
remain closed; they were not rechecked.

Scope: current product at `5cb8592`, the recorded reviews and canary 28. This is
not a new lane audit. Escalation correction and deployment verification are
closed; no further deployment checks, retries or paid runs are requested.

## Demonstrated behavior (with the evidence boundary)

| Behavior | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Correct Worker/container identity, async and runner flags | Live non-spending canary 36096052737, 2026-09-25 04:50:36 UTC: `5cb8592661ff`, `b83b0611aeecce8f`, both flags true. Balance 3. |
| Empty edit queues and reaches its stored terminal refusal; forged replay and unknown-job poll are rejected | Same live canary. This did not call a model or demonstrate a content edit. |
| Failed/unreadable add-on state and unusable answers stop; verified absence alone permits reconstruction; photo handoff and successful additions remain | Actual Worker responses through direct and queued browser handlers with stubbed providers: `test/addon-failure.test.mjs`, `test/addon-route.test.mjs`. Independent review and required CI green. |
| Untrusted edit/add-on replies cannot authorize success or another operation | `readRouteReply`, `readEditReply`, `readAddonReply`; controlled reply tests in `test/edit-reply-validation.test.mjs`, `test/addon-failure.test.mjs`. |
| Ask lock survives handoffs, releases once, blocks duplicate presses; old completions do not unlock newer requests | `siteEdit`, `editAsk`, `editAskDone`; `test/edit-lock.test.mjs`. Previously corrected, not reopened. |
| Edit-side result-display failure preserves known success and permits a next message | `applyEditResult`; `test/edit-result-display.test.mjs`, including credit-scheduling and redraw fault injection. Previously corrected, not reopened. |
| Served browser code matches reviewed code | Recorded byte comparison of live `chat.js`. Draft isolation, routing and preservation behavior also have controlled tests; those tests do not prove every real model response. |

## Implemented, but not established by this live verification

- A nonempty model-backed edit/addition through the real browser, queue, model,
  compiler, publish and result-display chain on this deployment.
- Its exact requested change, preservation of unrelated content/behavior,
  visible preview, truthful partial-result wording and per-operation billing.
- Live reconstruction and photo handoff with real providers. Controlled tests
  cover their decisions; the empty-edit canary does not exercise them.

These are missing observations, **not product defects**. Do not repeat completed
deployment checks or spend credits merely to relabel the same evidence.

## Known remaining defects and limits

| Item | Current-code evidence and precise scope |
| --- | --- |
| Add-on known-success fallback redraw — CLOSED, deployed at a5741864 | The owner independently reproduced an escaped queued display error; publication and request cleanup succeeded. The fallback now uses the existing edit-side guarded finish. Focused regressions cover direct/queued double failures, the subsequent message and a newer request started during redraw. Ordinary success-redraw controls remain. |
| Queued refusal redraw can escape | `watchEditJob` invokes the outcome reader from its async step; refusal branches call `finish` without containing a redraw exception. Recorded impact: the sentence remains and the request frees, but a rejection can escape. No new live incident is claimed. |
| Preview invalidation can be skipped after a synchronous scheduling exception | `applyEditResult` and `applyAddonResult` call `scheduleCreditRefresh()` before incrementing `previewV`. The injected synchronous throw is recorded. **Do not describe this as every failed balance request:** the actual scheduler defers `fetchCredits` in a timer, so an ordinary later network failure does not establish this sequence. |
| Queued handoff loses the one-hop marker | `watchEditJob` supplies `handedOff:false` to its reader, whereas `escalatedEdit` uses that flag for the hop limit. Latent guard gap: the recorded current data→text and picture→page destinations do not hop again. Not evidence of a current live loop. |

Drafts surviving site switches but not browser reload are an intentional
in-memory limit (`siteDraft`, `sitesSave`), not a newly found defect. The silent
duplicate latch is likewise a deliberate secondary guard, not a stranded-request
regression. Translation and model-written replies remain parked.

## Fallback-display correction closed

The owner independently reproduced the queued add-on double display failure.
The regression also failed before the patch with “the redraw failed” escaping.
The existing edit-side guard now contains that fallback redraw exception.

All 179 focused tests pass in edit-result-display, edit-lock and addon-failure:
one truthful success, no rewrite or extra handoff, busy/lock released, subsequent
message completes, and an older completion leaves a newer request alone.
The harness reads normalize CRLF so these controls also run on Windows.

This is an escaped display error, not a failed publication or stranded request.
Independent review accepted the patch and all 179 focused tests. Required unit
CI [36098613431](https://github.com/canias7/isibi-app/actions/runs/36098613431)
passed (7,710 passed, zero failures). Site-build was not required for these paths.

Merged by fast-forward from unchanged main at 41abeaa5 to a5741864.
