# Remaining edit-path checklist

## Status after run 32 (2026-09-25)

**Closed since this record was written.** Each of these is merged, deployed and
live:
- queued refusal redraw escape;
- preview invalidation after a synchronous scheduling exception;
- the queued one-hop marker (all three by the edit-path milestone, deploy
  2158);
- literal-text loss on the full page writer, for parsed literal JSX prose and
  its request grammar (deploy 2158);
- the credit-refusal wording that states the edit charge and the routing charge
  apart (deploy 2159, runtime-confirmed by run 32's preflight).

**Shown live.** Run 32 (canary 36172189711): one real-model edit through the
quick writer. The edit moved a section on fretwork-1 and kept the surrounding
source byte for byte. Routing, the queue, the publish, billing (route 2 + edit 8
against a single reserve) and the reply are all confirmed. A real Chromium,
rendering TLS-verified live bytes, confirmed the order, the 3D guitar and the
availability box against the real `bookings_on_day` (1 → "5 places left.",
0 → "Six places left.").

**Still not shown live.**
- The full page writer on this deployment, with the text guard and the judge
  in `keepCheck`.
- A second message from the same browser.
- Photographs.
- A live add-on, and the picture, data and rules rungs.

**Still open.**
- #418 (phone-width hydration).
- The text guard's scope limits. The two ordinary page-qualified phrasings it
  refused with a correct answer are fixed on the branch (`ce913d06` + `8c0d67a1`), not
  merged; see [text preservation](edit-text-preservation.md).
- Next-task 4's other billing sentences and the charged refused step.
- The full revise on `incomplete` sites.
- Attachments dropped by an unusable routing answer.
- The add-on route's no-layer climbs.
- The "Check the preview" wording on an unknown outcome.

**Harness.** The canary's early after-read is fixed on
`claude/help-needed-ehlwlj` (`72885ca9`, not merged).

**Next.** Test 3 is revised and not dispatched: "Remove the ‘The first eight
chords’ section from the home page.", after `ce913d06` + `8c0d67a1` are merged and deployed,
about 17–25 credits. A publish is read against the actual stored output and the
live page; a refusal is read by its reason, which for the text guard does not
say which text.

Historical closure record. The subsequent owner-authorized [full edit-path
review](edit-path-milestone.md) records the queued marker, refusal-display and
preview-ordering corrections on the review branch. Closed deployments below
remain closed; they were not rechecked.

Scope: current product at `5cb8592`, the recorded reviews and canary 28. This is
not a new lane audit. Escalation correction and deployment verification are
closed; no further deployment checks, retries or paid runs are requested.

## Demonstrated behavior (with the evidence boundary)

| Behavior | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Correct Worker/container identity, async and runner flags | Live non-spending canary 36096052737, 2026-09-25 04:50:36 UTC: `5cb8592661ff`, `b83b0611aeecce8f`, both flags true. Balance 3. |
| Empty edit queues and reaches its stored terminal refusal; forged replay and unknown-job poll are rejected | Same live canary. This did not call a model or demonstrate a content edit. |
| Failed/unreadable add-on state and unusable answers stop; verified absence alone permits reconstruction; photo handoff and successful additions remain | Actual Worker responses through direct and queued browser handlers with stubbed providers: `test/addon-failure.test.mjs`, `test/addon-route.test.mjs`. Independent review and required CI green. |
| Untrusted edit/add-on replies cannot authorize success or another operation | `readRouteReply`, `readEditReply`, `readAddonReply`; controlled reply tests in `test/edit-reply-validation.test.mjs`, `test/addon-failure.test.mjs`. |
| Ask lock survives handoffs, releases once, blocks duplicate presses; old completions do not unlock newer requests | `siteEdit`, `editAsk`, `editAskDone`; `test/edit-lock.test.mjs`. Previously corrected, not reopened. |
| Edit-side result-display failure preserves known success and permits a next message | `applyEditResult`; `test/edit-result-display.test.mjs`, including credit-scheduling and redraw fault injection. Previously corrected, not reopened. |
| Served browser code matches reviewed code | Recorded byte comparison of live `chat.js`. Draft isolation, routing and preservation behavior also have controlled tests; those tests do not prove every real model response. |

## Implemented, but not established by this live verification

- A nonempty model-backed edit/addition through the real browser, queue, model,
  compiler, publish and result-display chain on this deployment.
- Its exact requested change, preservation of unrelated content/behavior,
  visible preview, truthful partial-result wording and per-operation billing.
- Live reconstruction and photo handoff with real providers. Controlled tests
  cover their decisions; the empty-edit canary does not exercise them.

These are missing observations, **not product defects**. Do not repeat completed
deployment checks or spend credits merely to relabel the same evidence.

## Known remaining defects and limits

| Item | Current-code evidence and precise scope |
| --- | --- |
| Add-on known-success fallback redraw — CLOSED, deployed at a5741864 | The owner independently reproduced an escaped queued display error; publication and request cleanup succeeded. The fallback now uses the existing edit-side guarded finish. Focused regressions cover direct/queued double failures, the subsequent message and a newer request started during redraw. Ordinary success-redraw controls remain. |
| Queued refusal redraw can escape | `watchEditJob` invokes the outcome reader from its async step; refusal branches call `finish` without containing a redraw exception. Recorded impact: the sentence remains and the request frees, but a rejection can escape. No new live incident is claimed. |
| Preview invalidation can be skipped after a synchronous scheduling exception | `applyEditResult` and `applyAddonResult` call `scheduleCreditRefresh()` before incrementing `previewV`. The injected synchronous throw is recorded. **Do not describe this as every failed balance request:** the actual scheduler defers `fetchCredits` in a timer, so an ordinary later network failure does not establish this sequence. |
| Queued handoff loses the one-hop marker | `watchEditJob` supplies `handedOff:false` to its reader, whereas `escalatedEdit` uses that flag for the hop limit. Latent guard gap: the recorded current data→text and picture→page destinations do not hop again. Not evidence of a current live loop. |

Drafts surviving site switches but not browser reload are an intentional
in-memory limit (`siteDraft`, `sitesSave`), not a newly found defect. The silent
duplicate latch is likewise a deliberate secondary guard, not a stranded-request
regression. Translation and model-written replies remain parked.

## Fallback-display correction closed

The owner independently reproduced the queued add-on double display failure.
The regression also failed before the patch with “the redraw failed” escaping.
The existing edit-side guard now contains that fallback redraw exception.

All 179 focused tests pass in edit-result-display, edit-lock and addon-failure:
one truthful success, no rewrite or extra handoff, busy/lock released, subsequent
message completes, and an older completion leaves a newer request alone.
The harness reads normalize CRLF so these controls also run on Windows.

This is an escaped display error, not a failed publication or stranded request.
Independent review accepted the patch and all 179 focused tests. Required unit
CI [36098613431](https://github.com/canias7/isibi-app/actions/runs/36098613431)
passed (7,710 passed, zero failures). Site-build was not required for these paths.

Merged by fast-forward from unchanged main at 41abeaa5 to a5741864.
[Deployment 2157](https://github.com/canias7/isibi-app/actions/runs/36099179983)
succeeded on 2026-09-25 at 05:35:53 UTC, deploying reviewed commit
`a57418643340b67f9d51210c903dbe18e1e532f3`. The deployment log reports the
existing SiteBuildContainer image reused; this is deployment-log evidence, not
a new runtime container observation. No container check or canary was run.

At 05:36:30 UTC, both https://gofarther.dev/chat.js and its cache-busted URL
returned HTTP 200 and were byte-identical to the reviewed git blob: 781,511 bytes,
SHA-256 `d873ddb00e7375f7b9ace05ad92954eb4947f8d98802ff45b5bbff14e34a2c36`.
This verifies the served correction. No paid run. Other checklist items remain
separate and unchanged; no next sweep or additional correction is started.
