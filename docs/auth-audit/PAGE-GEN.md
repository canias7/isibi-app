# Page generator — compile rate

**0/3 compiled**, 0 with no lint problems.

Three site shapes, each with its own schema, family and layout directive — a booking site, a
menu-only site with no form at all, and an internal tool where every page needs a signed-in member.

- booking (salon): 0/1 compiled
- menu (restaurant): 0/1 compiled
- tool (crm): 0/1 compiled

No database and no publish — this measures the GENERATOR, not the build path around it.
One call a sample, because a build makes one call: there is no repair pass, so this rate IS what the platform ships.
A single failure is variance; a column of the same error is a mismatch worth fixing.
