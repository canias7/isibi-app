## Two products, one Worker

- **Zephyr** — an AI image/video/voice generator at **isibi.ai**. Live, has
  paying customers, unrelated to the builder except that both run out of
  `worker.js`.
- **The site builder** — a customer describes a business in chat and gets a
  published website at **`<slug>.gofarther.app`**. `gofarther.dev` is the tool
  they use; `.app` is theirs. The builder is the active work.

---

## Working rules

- **Always show UI changes as screenshots in the chat** — render it headless and
  send the image. The owner reviews everything visually.
- **The owner directs design; don't restyle beyond what's asked.**
- **Don't spend fal credits or model calls on tests without asking first.**
- **Work on the designated branch**, not on main directly.
- **Never write GitHub's own skip-CI marker anywhere** — not in a commit message,
  not in a PR body, not while explaining it. GitHub scans the whole message and
  suppresses every workflow for that push: main moves, nothing deploys, nothing
  tests, and there is no red run to notice. **Done twice, both times inside prose
  about the rule itself.** In prose call it "the skip-CI marker" and never spell
  it. `test/deploy-secrets.test.mjs` holds the half that lives in the tree.
- **`[skip smoke]` in a commit message is OURS and is the ordinary case** — it
  skips the paid workflows. The owner-build marker is spelled ONLY inside a
  commit that is deliberately buying a build.
- **Never commit while a mutation sweep is running.** A killed sweep skips its
  `finally` and leaves a live mutant in the tree.
- **Every change ships with**: guard tests, a mutation sweep from a verified-green
  baseline with a comment-only control that must survive, the full unit suite,
  entries here and in owner-notes, and a push.
- **Stamp measured numbers only AFTER the run.** A result written before the run
  ends is a claim ahead of its evidence.

---

## Structure

- **`public/`** — the Zephyr frontend, plain HTML/CSS/JS: `index.html` (the
  chatbox, the only page), `styles.css`, `chat.js` (which is also the builder's
  client), `auth.js` (Supabase email/password + email-code via GoTrue fetch).
- **`worker.js`** — the Cloudflare Worker. Serves assets; Zephyr's
  `/api/video|image|audio` (fal.ai queue, per-kind model allowlists),
  `/api/direct` (the director — effort-routed Haiku/Sonnet, tool-use for
  structured output, a `research` step on Sonnet + `web_search_20250305`),
  `/api/import/fetch`, `/api/save`; and the builder's whole `/api/site/*` and
  `/api/db/*` surface. **It CAN be imported by tests** — the belief that it could
  not is why twelve features shipped dead; see the traps below.
- **`builder/`** — the site builder. `lovable/template/` is the kit and the app
  scaffold (React 19 + Tailwind v4 + TanStack Start; 2,112 components in
  `src/components/ui/`, plus ~880 chart primitives under `charts/lib/`);
  `build-server.mjs` is the container's HTTP service;
  `page-gen.mjs`, `publish-pages.mjs`, `site-*.mjs` are plain modules, importable
  and tested outside the Worker.
- **Supabase** (`ujrqdmmtcptvimazlhom`) — platform auth, the credit ledger, the
  `media` bucket, `site_backends` / `site_project` / `site_builds`.
- **Neon** — one project per SITE, holding that site's own database.
- **R2** — everything that is not rows: `sites/` (published), `source/` (page
  source), `uploads/`, `versions/`, `backups/`, `sitemeta/`, `config/`,
  `orphans/`, `jobs/`.
- **Media Agent** — Instagram/YouTube manager via Composio. Read + comment
  auto-reply live; DM auto-reply blocked on Meta App Review. Details in
  `docs/media-agent.md`.
- **Universal memory** — auto-learned creative taste applied to every Zephyr
  generation. Backend only, no UI, deliberately.

## Deploy

Push to `main` → GitHub Actions → Wrangler → Cloudflare Workers → isibi.ai.
~3–4 minutes, and **a push that touches `builder/` rolls the container image**:
wait **15–20 minutes** before firing a build that must run the new code. An
instance started seconds after "deploy completed" is still on the previous image.

Secrets live in GitHub Actions and upload to the Worker each deploy. **An
optional secret must carry a `|| fallback`; a required one must not** — listing a
name with no value fails the WHOLE deploy (three merges shipped nothing that way).

---

## How a site gets built

`POST /api/site/react-build` (also `/api/site/build`, `/api/site/react-revise`) —
auth-gated, idempotent, a slug claimed by whoever builds it first (409).

1. **Route** (`/api/site/route`, Haiku, ~0.3 credits) — is this a build, a
   question, a clarify round, or one of the cheap edit layers? **Every unclear
   case resolves to work, never to prose**: a wrong "build" is visible and
   undoable, a wrong "ask" is indistinguishable from the builder being broken.
2. **Design** (`design_schema`, one tool call) — the model answers the whole plan.
3. **Provision** — a Neon project + database, but **only if the spec declares
   tables or the site already has one**. A first build is frontend-only by
   default, so most sites never get a database.
4. **Generate** (`write_pages`) — ONE model call, no repair pass.
5. **Compile** — `tsc --noEmit` then `vite build` in the container.
6. **Render check** — a real Chromium opens every route at two widths.
7. **Salvage** — a page that will not compile is replaced by a stub, never a live
   page (`livePages`), and the build publishes.
8. **Publish** — write-then-sweep into R2, then upload the site's own Worker
   script.

**The build fires and the Worker walks away.** A queue consumer runs it (15
minutes guaranteed); the generation itself runs in the CONTAINER (no clock) and
**streams**, because an idle wire is hung up at ~270s by the egress. The answer
is POSTed to `/api/site/genresult` and stored in R2, so a recycled container
cannot lose it. A later short invocation collects it. The whole-build budget is
13 minutes with a 4-minute publish reserve; the early placeholder goes up the
moment the design lands, so no failure can leave the customer with nothing.

**Billing**: metered on real token usage, priced per model from ONE table, four
token kinds priced apart (fresh / output / cache read 0.1× / cache write 1.25×),
rounded ONCE across all calls in a build. `ourFault(stage)` exempts our own
failures. A placeholder costs nothing. `buildFloor(model)` gates up front and
refunds if it refuses.

---

## What the design call decides

`design_schema` is one tool, ~69k characters, in the cached block. Property order
IS generation order. The fields, in order:

- **`kind`** — `shopfront | tool`. Decided first, because everything else is an
  answer about the kind. **A tool's front page IS the tool**: no hero, no
  marketing bands, no team section, no closing pitch, and `planBudget` answers
  **0 photographs** — arithmetic, not prose, because the model ignored "no
  photographs anywhere" on four consecutive builds.
- **`purpose`, `action`, `pages`, `shape`, `components`, `images`** — the plan.
  `MAX_PAGES` in the PLAN is **1** (the front page is the site) and
  `MAX_COMPONENTS` **15**, a ceiling with **no floor** — a floor is a quota and a
  model fills a quota. **`page-gen.mjs` keeps its own `MAX_PAGES = 6`
  deliberately**: a full revise hands every stored page back through validation,
  so capping there would delete pages off a live multi-page site on an unrelated
  edit. New builds are one page because the PLAN is.
  **One page is one job**: a band that is really a second screen is left out, not
  stacked below. `shape` carries the 13 universal site shapes as reference —
  named geometry, no trade and no kit component, so nothing can be pasted.
- **`theme`** — one of a 100-name shortlist, out of a 500-theme registry
  (`builder/site-theme-registry.mjs`). `FIELD_KEEPS.theme` judges against all 500,
  so a stored off-shortlist theme survives every merge.
- **`favicon`** — a complete SVG document the model draws. `cleanFavicon` is an
  allow-list that **refuses whole**: 18 elements, ~50 attributes, no `script`,
  no `href` of any kind, entities decoded before the danger checks. We own the
  document element, the model owns the shapes.
- **`wordmark`** — the literal `text` (the name in type, the right answer for
  most) or one drawn SVG. Sized from its own viewBox, because the header
  constrains by height.
- **`css`** — the model's own stylesheet, appended LAST so it wins on source
  order. The 500 themes are the base; this is the layer a customer asks for.
- **`langs`, `seeds`, `description`, `share`** and the backend half (tables,
  functions, apis, jobs) — the backend fields are **omitted from a first build**
  entirely (41% of the tool on the wire).

**Every design decision is anchored on a revise.** `EDIT_FIELDS` + `mergeLook`:
absent means unchanged, so a colour change cannot re-roll the theme.
`currentStateNote` shows the model what is stored, derived from `EDIT_FIELDS` so
a new field cannot be changeable-but-invisible.

---

## The published site

**Each site is its own Worker script** in a dispatch namespace. A Worker cannot
load code at runtime, so "one Worker serving whichever site was asked for" is
impossible — which is why a framework upgrade means republishing every site
(`site_rebuilds`, one at a time, no credits).

- **One public address**: `<slug>.gofarther.app`. `/s/<slug>/` 301s to it and is
  the internal addressing scheme. A custom domain returns to ITSELF.
- **The document is rendered per request** from `__root.tsx` — there is no
  prerender step and no HTML in the dist.
- **The head** is the baked half (`site-brand.ts`, written per build) plus the
  publish-time half (the R2 sidecar): title, description, canonical, og:* (url,
  site_name, type, locale + alternates, image + dimensions for the composed card
  only, alt), twitter:card, theme-color, verification tags, icon, apple-touch-icon.
- **The share card** is composed free at build time — the name (or the drawn
  wordmark) and the description on the theme's paper, screenshotted at 1200×630
  into `dist/client/card.png`. Precedence for `og:image`: **the owner's chosen
  upload → any owner upload → the card. Never a visitor's file.**
- **Assets are relative** (`base: "./"`), so the platform rewrites them absolute;
  `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` carry a placeholder origin substituted at serve
  time, because the same bytes serve at three addresses.
- **A route the site does not have is a 404**, and a renamed page redirects — both
  read out of a manifest in the head.
- **`dir` follows the language**, derived from the script, and the kit is on
  logical utilities so it really mirrors.

## Editing a site — the ladder

The router picks a layer; each falls through to the one above it when it cannot
express the change. Cheapest first:

| Layer | What it changes | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | words in the page source | 0 credits |
| `data` | rows, and a list's ORDER | ~0.3 |
| `rules` | schema features enforced in Postgres or read from `_meta` | ~0.3 |
| `look` | theme, colours, the 29 style axes, fonts, language | ~0.3 |
| `picture` | swap or reframe a photograph (matched on its alt text) | ~0.3 |
| `logo` | the header logo — the attachment IS which picture | 0 |
| `nav` | menu, header button, footer contact/social/legal, in-body links | ~0.3 |
| `page` | one page's layout, via `tweak` (Haiku, minimal patch) | ~1–3 |
| `addon` | a real page rewrite | ~25 |

**`sameProse` is the guarantee the page layer cannot make**: a tweak that moved
the words is thrown away. Measured 0 false alarms over 1,640 real tweaks.

Every cheap edit republishes through `recompileAndPublish` — the shared spine.
**Anything a build bakes must be sent by that spine too**, or a typo fix silently
strips it.

---

## Data, auth, payments, mail

- **Neon per site.** `site-schema.mjs` is the engine: `isibi.schema.json` in,
  DDL out. Access is **two axes** (`read` × `write`), with five preset names as
  shorthands — `normalizeSchema` stamps `access: "collect"` on a pair-declared
  table, so **always ask `resolveAccess(t)`, never the preset name** (that misread
  has cost five separate bugs).
- **RLS on every table**, keyed on `app_user_id()`. `read: "none"` emits NO SELECT
  policy — the write-only guarantee is the ABSENCE of the statement.
- **Neon Auth** is identity (`neon_auth."user"`, UUID). Always schema-qualified
  and quoted: bare `FROM user` resolves to the `USER` value function and returns
  a wrong answer rather than erroring.
- **Neon's Data API** is the data path; ours was deleted. `/api/db/<slug>/*` is
  transport only.
- **Payments = the owner's OWN Stripe key**, in the site's own `_secrets`. Not
  Connect; we are never in the money flow. **The price comes from the site's own
  rows, never the browser** — a payable table gets no public INSERT grant at all.
- **Mail from a site to its customers = the owner's own key.** `env.EMAIL` is
  OURS (login codes, 200/day) and the builder may not touch it.
- **The line**: we provide hosting, the database, the data API and member sign-in.
  Anything that spends the owner's money or sends mail as their business is
  bring-your-own. The test for anything new: does it need a credential AND a
  network call? Then it is platform code, because a published site is static
  files and Postgres on Neon has no HTTP client.

---

## Credits & monetization

1 credit = $0.008 of fal cost. Postgres RPCs: `get_credits`/`use_credits` (20
granted on first touch), `add_credits` (service-role, mint-key gated, idempotent
on `purchases.ref`), `credit_back` (≤10/call), `is_paid`. Stripe live since
2026-07-08 — memberships Plus/Pro/Max ($24.99/$49.99/$99.99) plus top-ups; the
webhook verifies its HMAC and mints. Free accounts get watermarks; gallery
storage is a membership benefit (10/50/100 GB).

**`use_credits` is a GATE, not a till**: a bill larger than the balance debits
ZERO and returns -1. `collectCredits` takes what is there and `billed` records
what the work cost.

---

## Live state (2026-08-28)

- **Owner's live sites**: `northgroup-9` … `northgroup-17`, `markbook-1`,
  `shoeroom-1`, plus older `fold-lane-bakery`, `harbourside-roast`,
  `the-lido-cafe`, `oak-and-ash`, `forno-and-co`. **Reusing one of those slugs
  REVISES that site.**
- **Balance: 18 credits** (verified against the ledger 2026-08-28) — under one
  build. The favicon, wordmark, share card, share picker and head pack are all
  **NOT PROVEN LIVE** for want of a top-up.
- **The building account is `aniascristian@gmail.com`, not the session's own
  address.** It owns every live site and holds that balance. Look at the wrong
  row and the balance reads as zero.
- **Analytics is collecting** and has been since the CSP fix on 2026-08-15: 451
  pageloads in the 7 days to 2026-08-28 across ~25 hostnames. Config
  `53fa6238…`, token `16ed2075…`, `auto_install: true`. `rum report` reads it
  free and read-only.
- **`site build` is 300/300** against the real container; the unit suite is 4,426.
- **Default builder model is Grok** (`DEFAULT_PICKER`), ~3.5× cheaper than Sonnet
  on a comparable site and ~3× slower on the pages call. Sonnet is one click away.
- **A cold new account is one credit short of building**: `buildFloor(sonnet)` is
  20, the grant is 20, and the routing call spends 1 first. Owner's call is to
  fund the test account rather than raise the grant; `test/build-models.test.mjs`
  pins it.

---

## THE TRAPS

Every one of these has cost at least one session, most of them several. Read this
before writing a guard.

**The wiring layer.** Twelve-plus features have shipped DEAD with the module
perfectly correct and one hop cut: a value computed and never forwarded, a dep
injected and never called, a field decided and never put on the wire. From
outside, "the model did not set it" and "we did not forward it" are the same
`undefined`. **Before rewording a prompt because a field came back empty, check
that the field can arrive.** Assert the CHAIN, end to end, and derive it from the
producer rather than listing today's hops.

**Assert the property, not the spelling.** The single most repeated own-goal here.
A guard pinned to `foo(a, b)` goes red the moment an honest third argument
arrives, reporting that the feature is gone. Anchor on what must be TRUE.

**Never size a source-read window in bytes.** Ten-plus instances. This repo puts
its reasoning in comments, so any byte window is outrun by the next comment.
Window from landmark to landmark, and assert both landmarks exist — `indexOf`
answering -1 gives `slice(-1, -1)` = `""`, which passes every assertion inside it.

**Overlapping windows.** A window that runs to a NAMED neighbour swallows whatever
is inserted between them, and a mutation in the wrong half then passes. Derive the
closing landmark from the next sibling.

**Prose contains the thing it forbids.** A comment explaining a deletion spells
the deleted name; a comment arguing for a class name contains that class name.
Nine-plus instances, several inside the guard written for that very trap. **Blank
whole-line comments (length-preserving) before any scan.**

**A negative assertion must prove its observer is alive.** `[].every(...)` is
`true`. A loop over an empty collection contributes no checks to fail. Assert a
floor on what was scanned before believing an absence.

**Inert mutants.** Sixteen-plus recorded. A mutation that changes no behaviour
reads exactly like a test gap and costs a hunt through checks that are fine.
Before believing a survivor, prove the mutation changed something.

**A mutant that never applied.** The mirror. `grep -qF "$to"` is vacuous when the
replacement is empty or common — verify by CHECKSUM. **A sweep whose control never
applied is a sweep with no control.**

**Two lists of the same thing.** Routes in a matcher and in a dispatch condition;
a scanner's list and the kit's. They drift, and the drift is silent. Derive one
from the other, in BOTH directions where the scan can stop matching.

**`String(["a"])` is `"a"`.** Shipped as a real bug three times — a one-element
array passing as a role, an access level, a language. Refuse a non-string; never
coerce.

**`X["constructor"]` is truthy.** Shipped once in the Stripe plan lookup and
nearly again three times since. `Object.hasOwn`, never truthiness, for any
caller-supplied key.

**Flat scans where depth matters.** Written wrong five-plus times. `\(([^)]*)\)`
stops at the first `)`, which is usually inside a nested call. Argument lists,
object literals and selector lists all need a depth-aware splitter.

**A fixture more capable than reality.** `setTotp`'s fake did a partial update the
real one could not; a path fixture used a shape the pipeline never produces. A
fake that is MORE capable hides bugs exactly like one that is less.

**A rule true because of a layer below it expires when that layer moves,
and nothing announces it.** `#/` hrefs were correct under hash history; a
comment's reasoning about `ctx.waitUntil` was true until the queue landed. When
something one layer down changes, re-ask what rested on it.

**A false alarm is worse than a miss.** A check that flags correct code teaches
the model — and the next session — away from something that works. Any new lint
measures its false-alarm rate against the real corpus and must reach ZERO before
it ships.

**A failure that cannot name itself.** Six-plus instances: four different causes
wearing one sentence, a status with no reason, a report that died with the socket.
When two failures need opposite fixes, they must be distinguishable from outside.

**`pgrep -f` / `pkill -f` match your own shell.** Ten-plus instances — the harness
wraps the command in a shell whose command line contains the pattern, so
`pkill -f x` kills the thing running it (exit 144, empty log) and
`until ! pgrep -f x` never exits. Kill by PID; watch a log's tail.

**Re-run the thing the change is asserted by.** Appeasing a false alarm in one
checker while never re-running the harness that actually proves the change has
shipped red twice.

**The container harness sees what the unit suite structurally cannot.** A CSS
change, a compiled stylesheet, a rendered head, a real PNG's dimensions — all
invisible to a source read. `site build` is the strongest free signal here.

**A guard watching the layer below the break.** It asserts the plumbing and not
the connection: "the query selects the column" while nothing carries it onward.

**Vacuous ordering.** `indexOf(a) < indexOf(b)` passes when `a` is the thing
deleted (-1 < anything). Prove both anchors exist first.

---

## Backlog

- **The dead-control finding (open).** On `northgroup-17` the stage filters,
  "New deal" and the deal rows are all `<a href="#pipeline">`, and 15 of 24
  in-page links point at the section they already sit inside — dead by
  construction, while the reply claims the filters run. A lint for a control that
  goes nowhere is the next thing.
- **`env.EMAIL` daily quota is 200** across login codes AND every site's booking
  notifications. Worth watching, not yet a problem.
- **Scheduled-jobs tier**: 26 jobs registered, zero sends ever — three call sites
  pass a Supabase ROW where a connection string is wanted. Not fixed deliberately
  (fixing it starts 26 real senders; owner's call).
- **Static voice previews** — the owner drops MP3s at `public/voices/<name>.mp3`.
- **Real background removal** — needs a fal utility wired as an orchestrator step;
  blocked on a fal top-up.
- **fal balance is empty**, so no generated photograph has ever been bought on a
  site. Every `SafeImage` on every published site draws its placeholder.
- **Mobile layout for the app is deliberately NOT being done** (owner's call,
  desktop-first).
